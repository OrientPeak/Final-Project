Project proposal
The project would be an idle game similar to cookie clicker but in vr. The second part of it is somewhat similar to a boxing but every time the character is punched the player gets currency and after collecting enough gets upgrades. 
  
Depending on the time available I plan to add different things to the screen that would be visually representing the upgrades. Including those the depending on the time available I plan to add permanent upgrades the character gets when prestigeing as well as maybe adding the ability to “kill” the character that is being punched for extra boost of money. To avoid having problems with overflows since the numbers would be very big I plan to add a conversion similar to adventure capitalist.
 
Maybe the last addition I might do is if a specific perk is unlocked with prestige points the player gets to pick if they want a skill tree for active playing where they might get another thing to interact with and an increase to the currency per hit or they pick the idle route where the upgrades get an increased currency gain.
